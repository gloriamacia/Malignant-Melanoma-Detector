# Skin-Cancer-Detection-using-a-Computer-based-System
Computer-based system to classify histopathological images of skin tissue. Malignant Melanoma detection.
For more information about the detector visit my personal/professional blog https://techieladyblog.wordpress.com/ or read the project wiki (I spent a lot of time explaining how the detector works, how to use it and what can you to make it better). 

Notice also that this is my first contribution to open source software (still a newbie) so your feedback is really important to me. Collaborations, comments or suggestions about how to improve any aspect of the project are welcome. 

If you loved the project or you have an innovative idea to ease the burden of your national health service that could be also applied to any other country... I would like to hear about it! Contact me using github or alternatively at gloriamaciamunoz@gmail.com.
